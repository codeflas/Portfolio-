Digital Portfolio Website

CS5709 – Software Engineering Evolution (2025/6 SEM1)

🔗 Live Website: https://shubhambiradar.com/

1. Project Overview

This repository documents the digital portfolio website developed as part of the CS5709 – Software Engineering Evolution module in the MSc in Software Engineering at the University of Limerick.

The portfolio represents an evolving software artefact, designed to showcase academic background, technical projects, professional experience, and contact information in a modern, interactive, and publicly deployed format.

While the module’s minimum guideline suggested static hosting (e.g., GitHub Pages), this project deliberately exceeded the defined scope by:

Acquiring a custom domain

Deploying the site on a professional hosting platform

Enforcing HTTPS security

Integrating interactivity, animations, and communication features

Considering SEO, analytics readiness, and long-term maintainability

2. Live Deployment

Domain: https://shubhambiradar.com/

Hosting Platform: Hostinger

Protocol: HTTPS (TLS enabled)

Deployment Type: Production-grade public website

The website is publicly accessible and represents the final evolved version of the project.

3. Key Features
3.1 User Interface & Experience

Professionally minimalistic design

Slide / glide animations for smooth navigation

Subtle interactive elements

Live GIF integration

Responsive layout across devices

Multiple “Get in Touch” call-to-action sections

3.2 Content Sections

About / Profile

Academic & Technical Projects

Experience and Work Highlights

Visual media (images, animations)

Contact & Connectivity

3.3 Communication & Connectivity

Integrated email connectivity, allowing visitors to contact directly via the website

External professional links:

LinkedIn

Email

3.4 Location Awareness

Embedded interactive Google Maps

Location set to University of Limerick, providing professional and academic context

4. SEO, Analytics, and Web Standards

The website was developed with awareness of modern web visibility and quality standards:

SEO-conscious structure and keyword refinement

Semantic HTML usage

Analytics-ready architecture (future extensibility)

Performance-conscious asset handling

5. Security Considerations

HTTPS enforced across the site

Valid security certificates enabled

Secure modern browser compatibility

No insecure mixed-content usage

These measures align with contemporary secure software delivery practices.

6. About the Source Code Availability

Important Note for Examiners and Reviewers

The live website was developed and deployed using Hostinger’s web hosting and site-building platform.
As a result:

The exact underlying source code is not directly exportable in a conventional Git-based project structure.

The platform abstracts deployment, security, and optimisation layers internally.

This repository therefore serves as:

A technical documentation artefact

A representation of the evolved system

A supporting academic deliverable aligned with CS5709 requirements

The primary system of record for evaluation is the live deployed website at:

7. Alignment with Software Engineering Evolution

This project demonstrates core software evolution principles taught in CS5709:

Iterative enhancement rather than one-time delivery

Progressive improvement in structure, usability, and deployment

Reflection-driven evolution based on feedback

Documentation as a first-class engineering activity

Transition from academic prototype to production-ready system
